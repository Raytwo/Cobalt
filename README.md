## Bug reports
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before opening an issue, make sure to consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/wiki) to see if your problem is already addressed.  
> Assuming your problem is already explained in the Wiki and you still opened an issue, we might close the issue without replying.
