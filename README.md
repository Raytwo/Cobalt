## Bug reports
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before opening an issue, make sure to consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/wiki) to see if your problem is already addressed.  
> Assuming your problem is already explained in the Wiki and you still opened an issue, we might close the issue without replying.

> Issues are primarily meant for Cobalt contributors to keep track of genuine problems, so please do your due diligence.

In the case where you are certain the issue comes from Cobalt itself, consider [opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/issues/new/choose). Eventually provide a screenshot of the error message to make it easier.

## I'm a dev and would like to submit changes, how do I build this?
