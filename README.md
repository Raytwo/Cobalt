## Bug reports
In the case where you are certain the issue comes from Cobalt itself, consider [opening an issue on this repository](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/issues/new). Eventually provide a screenshot of the error message to make it easier.

## Where are the sources?
The code is not ready to be used by other people for the time being, as the project this runs on is unreleased for the same reasons. This might change in the future.
If you are the kind of person who only uses open-source homebrews, I'd rather you don't come to rant about it and just don't use this.
